## Motivation
Reinforcement learning of Connect4 against the famous Minimax algorithm

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, to get our Notebooks, Presentation and Project Report.

```
git clone https://github.com/Mavengence/DQL_Connect4_Mathematical_Data_Science_SS2020.FAU.git
```

- Final Presentation as [PDF](https://github.com/Mavengence/DQL_Connect4_Mathematical_Data_Science_SS2020.FAU/blob/master/presentation/Presentation.pdf)
- Final Paper as [PDF](https://github.com/Mavengence/DQL_Connect4_Mathematical_Data_Science_SS2020.FAU/blob/master/paper/Paper.pdf)

### Run the Notebook

```
cd/you_cloned_repo_location jupyter notebook

python connect4.py
```

- You start the training process with the connect4.py
- You start the GUI by calling play_gui() at the end of the file
- You need to select the depth of the Minimax and the Episodes at the end of the file

### Deployment

Just pull the repo, if you wanna change sth you can ask :)
